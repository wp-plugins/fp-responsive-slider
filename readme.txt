FP Responsive Slider is a tiny plugin that creates a responsive slider using elements inside a container. FP Responsive Slider works with wide range of browsers including all IE versions from IE6 and up. It also adds css max-width support for IE6 and other browsers that don't natively support it. Only dependency is jQuery (1.6 and up supported) and that all the images are same size.
